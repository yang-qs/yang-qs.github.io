I'm a final year undergraduate student from [Guanghua School of Management](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/) and will be a Ph.D. candidate in Upenn AMCS. My research interest includes network analysis, adversarial training, transformer and medical AI.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Song Xi Chen](https://songxichen.com/), [Prof. Yumou Qiu](https://yumou.org/) and [Prof. Cong Wang](https://www.gsm.pku.edu.cn/faculty/wangcong/). I learned a lot in the process of studying with these professors, and felt the fun of scientific research!ðŸ˜„

In my free time, I enjoy reading detective novels (Atticus PÃ¼nd, Poirot, and Ellery Queen), long-distance running, and painting. I also love watching Japanese anime. Additionally, I'm a huge fan of the Persona series!ðŸŽ®
